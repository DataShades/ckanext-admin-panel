# Utility Functions

Utility functions are meant to be used in the extension codebase to perform some specific tasks. They are defined in the `utils.py` file of the extension.

Some utils functions could be useful for other extensions as well. You can use them by importing the `ap_main.utils` module.

```python
import ckanext.admin_panel.utils as ap_utils
```
